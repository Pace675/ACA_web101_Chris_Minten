    <p class="one">So a little about me, eh? I tend to be fascinated in how things work, breaking things and doing my darnest to find better

      <p>I've been coding off and on since the 80s back in the days
        when 64kB of RAM was the bomb. From; Basic, AREXX, Machine Language,
        C+, C++ and learned most of those computer languages from research.
